# LPS follow-up plan API: Consumer guide

This API allows for the submission of
a [follow-up plan (oppf√∏lgingsplan)](https://www.nav.no/arbeidsgiver/oppfolgingsplan) to NAV and/or the general
practitioner. This API supports <i>delegation</i>,
which means that you as the API consumer are acting on behalf of another company/end-user. The API also supports
integration without <i>delegation</i>, which means
that you are submitting a follow-up plan on behalf of your own company.
This API is governed by the [terms of use](https://www.nav.no/_/attachment/inline/1dd039e8-08ec-4b65-9a85-f4d081b8feae:5014ae52e8b038c039a7afe8d2af01cf6f68bc27/Bruksvilk%C3%A5r%20Navs%20API%20for%20elektronisk%20innsending%20av%20oppf%C3%B8lgingsplan%20fra%20sluttbrukersystem%20kopi1.pdf), and by accessing or using this API, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.

## üéØ Target audience

This README is primarily intended for "L√∏nns- og personalsystemer" (Payroll and HR Systems) that wants to integrate with
NAV for submitting follow-up plans.

## üöÄ Getting started: Production guide

### 1. The employer must delegate rights to act on their behalf (optional)

<i>This step is not neccessary if you are acting on behalf of your own company.</i>

To submit a follow-up plan on behalf of an employer, the employer must delegate rights to the API (scope) to you as an
LPS system. This is done
in Altinn. Please refer to
the [Altinn documentation](https://altinn.github.io/docs/utviklingsguider/api-delegering/tilgangsstyrer/). Please note
that the employer can find our API by searching for <i>"Oppf√∏lgingsplan"</i> in Altinn, in the menu for <i>"Tilgang til
programmeringsgrensesnitt - API"</i>.

### 2. Configure a maskinporten-client

In order to use the API, you need to have a Maskinporten client configured. Please refer to
the [Maskinporten documentation](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_guide_apikonsument).

### 3. Retrieve a Maskinporten token

To retrieve a Maskinporten token, you need to send a POST request to the Maskinporten token
endpoint. Please refer to
the [Maskinporten documentation](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_summary.html) for more
information.
<br>

- Scope to be used when requesting token: `nav:oppfolgingsplan/lps.write`

### 4. Verify integration (optional)

If you want to verify that the integration works as expected, you can use the `verify-integration` endpoint. Please
refer to
the [Swagger documentation](https://lps-oppfolgingsplan-mottak.ekstern.dev.nav.no/swagger) for more information. Please
note that you will need to provide a valid Maskinporten token in the Authorization header.

### 5. Submit a follow-up plan

To submit a follow-up plan, you need to send a POST request with the required payload. The API will return a unique
uuid, which can be used later to check the sending status. Please refer to
the [Swagger documentation](https://lps-oppfolgingsplan-mottak.ekstern.dev.nav.no/swagger) for more information. Please
note that you will need to provide a valid Maskinporten token in the Authorization header.

### 6. Check the sending status (optional)

To check the sending status of a follow-up plan, you need to send a GET request with the uuid you received when
submitting the follow-up plan. Please refer to
the [Swagger documentation](https://lps-oppfolgingsplan-mottak.ekstern.dev.nav.no/swagger) for more information. Please
note that you will need to provide a valid Maskinporten token in the Authorization header.

## üß™ Testing guide for delegated setup

Please refer
to [NAV's guide for testing delegable API's](https://github.com/navikt/nav-ekstern-api-dok/blob/main/api-dok/teste-delegerbart-api/teste-delegerbart-api.md)

## üß™ Testing guide for non-delegated setup

Please refer
to [NAV's guide for testing API's](https://github.com/navikt/nav-ekstern-api-dok/blob/main/api-dok/teste-api/teste-api.md)

## üß™ Test users

Testdata for employee users: We have created 2 test users that skip the requirements for valid work relationship, and valid sick leave. Work relationship and sick leave testdata requires manual setup from us in Nav, so we have made these two users to make it easier testing without our involvement. The employeeIdentificationNumbers are 05908399546 and 01898299631.

## Error Codes

If you get an error, we will provide an ApiError object in the response body.
An ApiError will contain the following fields:
<pre>
- status: HttpStatusCode
- type: ErrorType
- message: String
</pre>

## üé¨ Demo

We have created a demo-app, which acts as an example of how you can implement the API. Here you will find relevant
input-fields with headers and descriptions for our API. When you fill out the demo-form, it will finally retrieve a
maskinporten-token on behalf of a random test-user, and submit this to our API on our test server. On the last page you
will be able to download a PDF, which looks similar to the PDF generated in production. <br>

Please note that the demo app only showcases the fields relevant for the API. This means that you are not limited to
these fields (and functionality) in your own application! We encourage you to customize the form to fit your own needs.
For example could `sykmeldingsgrad` be a relevant field for leaders, however NAV does not need this information, and it
is therefore not included in the API. <br>
